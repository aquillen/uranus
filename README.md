Code and display software used for obliquity evolution study

The mass-spring model code is built upon the N-body code rebound, 
see https://github.com/hannorein/rebound

Associated jupyter notebooks for looking at outputs is in myexamples/pylab/  
(though I tend to move code outputs into subdirectories before running it).

Slightly edited rebound code is in src/

Spring routines (not part of rebound) are in src_spring/
